## Tea as a metaphor

A tea leaf, after getting plucked, cannot be directly used for brewing. Once it is plucked, it must be wilted, crushed, oxidised and rolled before it can be used in any form. There is a transformation involved in the process, almost like a metamorphosis--a chain of chemical reactions that imparts flavour to the brew and meaning to its existence. The process is different for oolong, white, yellow, green, or fermented tea. Still, the struggle is real. It's different but real.

Obtaining a good brew is not difficult but requires mindfulness. Bring a cup of water to boil and take it off the heat. Let it cool down slightly--allowing the turbulence to disappear. Place a spoonful of tea leaves in the water and cover it. The stillness of the water allows the absorption of polyphenols and stimulants.

The brew time is different for different varietals. It might be of interest to observe how the water progressively turns darker with time. This is especially true for a batch that is new to you. Since different varietals and flushes attain different pigment shades at the end of perfect brewing time, it is important to periodically sip and check if the astringency levels are right. Once you are familiar with the brewing time of that batch, you can skip this process of titration.

This is no different from absorbing the essence of life around you. The laws that govern this world are chaotic at best and erratic at worst. How much of it you can distil into the stillness of your mind is a personal metric. Your preference of astringency may not match someone else's.

## The symbolism behind drinking tea

The act of drinking tea takes on a different function when drinking in solitude and in the company of one or more fellow beings.

Imagine yourself drinking tea all by yourself. The best you can do is to give yourself into the state you are in. At that moment, the tea is not only a catalyst for meditation but you yourself become a processor--a computational system where data is distilled into information, information is assimilated into knowledge and knowledge is clustered into ideologies. You test your stash of data against the various mental-models you have built in order to make sense of this world. You either assert the truth-hood of your models, evaluate the boundaries of such truth-hood, augment your models to expand those boundaries or downright reject the piece--annotating that the said piece of information has no place in any of your mental-models. This very act is the basis for the evolution of man made systems in and around us--ones that shape each of our actions at an individual level as well as in the context of the shared environment we all inhibit.

Now consider yourself drinking tea in the company of fellow beings. It fosters an environment for exchanging processed or partially-processed information. Indeed, you become part of a shared computational system--only that there may or may not be any ulterior motive to solve a problem or modify your mental-models. These bits must be treated differently and require deferred processing--perhaps with a different cup of tea, all alone. You will not remember many of those conversations will be. The human brain has this amazing ability to discard whatever is not essential for self-benefit.

No matter if you are drinking alone or with someone else, you are absorbing the essence of life itself along with the short-lived comfort and warmth of a brew.

## Eh! But why tea?

Most of what I have deduced to help me understand a bit more about myself and the environment that I inhabit have stemmed from the act of drinking tea--both alone as well as in the company of fellow human beings. Indeed, any beverage (or none at all) might have served its purpose but I can't help but appreciate the calming sensation that tea brings to my racing mind as opposed to the hyper-stimulation from coffee, the sugar rush from canned syrups and bottled juices, or the numbing effect of alcohol.

I am an entity just like everyone else. My existence in this timeline of events is to process and pass on information to a later event in the timeline. This may be via the propagation of my genes via procreation or replication or dissemination of information via oral or written medium. In either of the cases, it is expected of me as a computational entity to mutate, transform or distil the information before passing on to the later event.
