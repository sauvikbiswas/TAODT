1. The document is malleable as long as I keep actively working on it.
    * This malleability will ensure that the ideas are always structured in a coherent fashion.
    * The structure itself is morphable *ad infinitum*.
2. There is a closure in case I no longer work on it - out of a conscious decision, my inability to work, or my death.
    * This sunset clause, when effective, shall be the final form of **TAODT**.
    * Anyone is free to publish review, commentary or critical examination of the contents of **TAODT**.
3. This shall always remain a one-way communication - from myself to the reader. In essence, **TAODT** is a book.
    * Any discussion pertaining to any individual article or a collection thereof may be hosted outside on any platform that a reader deems to be fit for purpose. There shall not be any official medium of exchange endorsed by me.
