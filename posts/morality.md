## Morality as a personal predicate function

Morality is a social construct that drives personal mental models. The *Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy* states that "...*morality* refers to a code of conduct that would be accepted by anyone who meets certain intellectual and volitional conditions, almost always including the condition of being rational." The code of conduct is always expressed at an individual level and never *en masse*.

However, if we look a bit deeper, a moral function seldom exists without a society. Every individual, who is a member of the said society, asks himself, "Are my actions correct?" This pins down morality as a predicate function--one that yields a binary answer and ascertains some kind of truth-hood. But we are left with a second question. "*Correct* with respect to *what*?" In order to answer that, we must first analyse a different concept--the concept of shared identity.

When many individuals come together, they choose what intrinsic properties would they like to associate themselves to. Some of these are straightforward shared traits--ethnicity, common enemy. Some are democratically chosen values--like the mechanism of exchange of goods. Some are extrinsic properties--like those imposed by geography and climate--for example, food or clothing habits. Some extrinsic properties are imposed on an individual--like the idea of nationality.

With that, we can revisit our predicate function, "Are my actions correct?" and re-phrase the term *correct*--"Are my actions good for survival of my identity?"

### Spatial and temporal variation of morality

Spatial variation of morality is very simple and readily observed. There is a population threshold beyond which human beings cannot control themselves and would require external supervision to function as a singular unit. The identity of these small social clusters vary from cluster to cluster and hence the notion of morality. It might be difficult to find these variations and indeed there may not be any visible differences. However, at a larger geographical scale, we start observing these variations. Even a cluster of people, of relatively homogeneous ethnicity, but spread over a larger landmass will have different outcome to certain predicate functions. For example, an urban population that wants to build a road through a forest for its own benefit may be at odds with the people of a village whose livelihood depends on forest. The latter may even deify trees and may consider it a sin to cause mass deforestation.

At an even larger scale, geographical and climatic variation directly influence the identity properties of its inhabitants. This is evident with the vast number of population clusters spread all around the world. The list of immoral things that an Inuit in the snowy covers of Greenland might list would be very different from a Greek residing on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.

Some of these variations are purely derived from religious factors. A Tibetan shepherd who derives his identity from Tantric Buddhism--a system that evolved as a part of the set of Dharmic religions--would be very different from an Egyptian shepherd who derives his identity from Sunni Islam--a different system that evolved as a part of the set of Abrahamic religions.

Temporal variation of morality can be understood by answering a simple question--"What was moral then that is not now?" As a predicate function, we can also pose the converse question--"What is moral now that was not then?". Here is an example that answers the first question--human sacrifice. In many cultures, the idea of sacrificing human beings to appease a deity was of supremely high ideological value in a society. While today there are isolated cases that are associated with smaller cults, by and large, most people consider it to be immoral. Here is a concept that can be one of the answers to the latter question--gender equality in developing and developed societies.

Both the answers in the previous paragraph are properties of a society--past or present. Let us examine if these propositions really fit our question--"Are my actions good for survival of my identity?" For both, one has to ask the following questions to an individual--"Do you support human sacrifice?", "Do you support the idea of gender equality?" In both cases, the individual associates identities for himself. They may be pro-life, atheism, agnosticism, feminism, follower of immortal declaration or an egalitarian. These are identity properties that will govern the outcome of answering the "Are my actions good for survival of my identity?" question.

## Ethics and its relation to morality

The line between ethics and morals is slightly hazy. Ethics doesn't stem from an individuals identity. Instead they are a cluster of properties derived from an external environment. More often than not, there exists a set of desirable properties in a closed society--a company, an institution--and any external individual who joins this society is required to adhere to this property.

The question that one asks--or to be precise, is required by the closed society to ask--"Are my actions good for the survival of this particular closed society's identity?" Some identity properties that might yield positive outcomes to the question in a society like a multi-national conglomerate  would be hard work, honesty, transparency, etc.

The answer to this is sometimes at odds with the predicate function of morality. What is good for survival of one's individual identity may not be good for the collective identity.

It must be mentioned that in this context, the meaning is restricted to applied ethics.

## Then what about law?

Law is codification of shared morality. The codification--and by extension, the enforcement--relies on a political system. The basis of the political system is immaterial. As long as an individual acts within the domain of the political system, the expressed behaviour is subjected to the predicate function constructed by the codification.

Since it exists within a political system, a critical mass is needed to justify the existence of a set of  codified function. A small group of hunter-gatherers, not under the purview of any system of government, mainly functions using a set of ethical functions. However, for a political system, the variation in the outcome of ethical functions of various closed groups (and by extension, the outcome of moral functions of individuals) is undesirable. Here, the question becomes "Are my actions good for the survival of this political entity's identity?"

Thus the outcome of this predicate function may at times conflict with the outcome of a group's question for identity. Often times these manifest as protests by communities who think that their ideologies are marginalised by the government. The outcome may be different when compared to the outcome of an individual's question for identity. Often times these manifest as crimes committed with the best of personal intentions, including some horrible ones--for example, honour killings.

It must be noted that law acts as a regulatory system. The identity of a political entity feeds back into the identity of society and thus into the identity of an individual. The converse is also true. Law often gets amended to account for identities it had not accounted for earlier. If the codification is strict to the point where alteration to the codified is nearly impossible, the outcome of the questions at an individual and a closed society's level diverge with time with respect to the outcomes of the codified law. Such political systems often implode.
