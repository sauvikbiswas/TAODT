## Discretisation as a fundamental computation

The fundamental building blocks of all our mental models--and thus our world-view--are objects. These objects are sometimes tangible (cups, bicycles, wheels) and sometimes abstract (red, anger, satisfaction, walking). Everything exists within a plane of continuum.

We discretise as we may deem fit. We create objects to explain the world around us and thus improve predictability.

For tangible objects, the boundaries are often created by our visual and--to a lesser extent--our tactile sensory information. The method is no different from, say, that used by edge-detection algorithms. Our mind continually looks for sharp changes in sensory fields. Sometimes it relies on higher-order rates of changes, too. In the continuum of atoms in space, our imaging retina gives us the bounds of various entities in our field of vision. The same can be said for the collision of our body parts with various entities that are essentially pockets of densely-packed atoms.

For the abstract, the boundaries are slightly fuzzier. The discretisation process is heavily governed by the culture--a necessity to define an object for a mental model that will help us navigate some constructs that makes sense in the context of the culture. For example, where does red end and mauve begin? Or, where does anger end and grudge begin? Or, where does satisfaction end and contentment begin? Or, where does walking end and running begin?

Let us revisit our tangible object. We can argue that the objectification of the entity depends on the culture as well. To an end user, a bicycle is an entity--an object as a whole. He might be aware of the parts and the names assigned to them as objects--the wheels, the saddle, the handlebar, etc. The wheel itself might built out of other objects--hub, bearings, spokes, nipples, rim, tube, tyre. A material scientist might argue that the tyre is composed of at least three different compounds of rubber--each having different names and different properties--each one carefully placed to improve rolling resistance as well as grip. This objectification doesn't exist in the vernacular of the common end-user of the bicycle.

In the absence of tangibility, discretisation of the abstract is at the mercy of the culture. It is possible to have an elastic boundary to the abstract concept encompassing as much as possible or discarding as much as possible when one moves from one culture to another. This is true even if the two cultures--in the most conventional sense--speak the same language.

## Two formal definitions

We come across an important concept here--*objectification*. Objectification is the action of defining boundaries (closed or open) to a perceived continuum and assigning a linguistic symbol to what has been enclosed in the said boundary. The action of defining boundaries itself can be termed as *discretisation*.

Most tangible objects use closed boundaries, or at least they do in the three-dimensional visible space. However we may assign a linguistic symbol--in this case a word--to certain objects that are bounded on one side. Exosphere, running, anger could be deemed as examples of objects bounded on one side. However, we may argue that depending on the context--cultural or otherwise--we may choose to define the other boundary, too. Exosphere may give way to the space, running may give way to dashing, and anger could give way to rage.

Objectification is the basis of all mental models.

## Fractal nature of objectification

The nature of objectification is such that the action and the resultants of discretisation are self-similar at various scales and any measurement--like size or countability--of these objects are hard to define without imposing some bounds on the scale itself. With infinite regress as an inherent property, this makes the behaviour very fractal-like.

The example involving the nomenclature of bicycle and its parts is a good, simple example. We progressively delved into smaller and smaller scales. This process can be done at even lower and lower scales, *ad infinitum*.

It might be worthwhile to look into an abstract concept and see how this property holds.
