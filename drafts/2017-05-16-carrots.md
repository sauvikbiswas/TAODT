## Carrots that your boss is showing you

Most corporations are not people centric. These socio-economic designs of industrialisation care more about how much they can squeeze out of their customers and often ignore their own employees. In a society where labour is cheap and complexity of work is such that the ability to find a replacement is relatively easy, corporations often use this as a lever to underpay the efforts of their own employees.

A corporation exists to serve its customers and in turn receive a monetary benefit. The ratio of distribution of the benefit, after paying the shareholders, is proportional to the difficulty in finding a replacement. Cal Newport has written a book about how one can [make themselves irreplaceable](http://amzn.to/2rmROfr).

Still, as we know from Pareto's Principle, 20% of the workforce in a corporation will grab 80% of the money. The rest 80% ensures that they feed the other 20%. The solution is a socialistic system but that doesn't work if the population of the system exceeds the cumulative resource the system has to offer - the per capita resource falls below what is needed for leading a satisfactory life.

You know that is true; else, the 80% wouldn't have been replaceable in the first place.

In order to motivate the 80% of the workforce, the other 20% invents carrots. They come in various shapes and colours. There are numerous books written on [this subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_engagement) and [entire organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup_(company)) that make a business out of [th](http://dilbert.com/strip/2009-11-25)[is](http://dilbert.com/strip/2014-3-17).
