<li>The document is malleable as long as I keep actively working on it.<ul>
<li>This malleability will ensure that the ideas are always structured in a coherent fashion.</li>
<li>The structure itself is morphable <em>ad infinitum</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a closure in case I no longer work on it--out of a conscious decision, my inability to work, or my death.<ul>
<li>This sunset clause, when effective, shall be the final form of <strong>TAODT</strong>.</li>
<li>Anyone is free to publish review, commentary or critical examination of the contents of <strong>TAODT</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This shall always remain a one-way communication--from myself to the reader. In essence, <strong>TAODT</strong> is a book.<ul>
<li>Any discussion pertaining to any individual article or a collection thereof may be hosted outside on any platform that a reader deems to be fit for purpose. There shall not be any official medium of exchange endorsed by me.</li>
