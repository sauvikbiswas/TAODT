<h2>Discretisation as a fundamental computation</h2>
<p>The fundamental building blocks of all our mental models--and thus our world-view--are objects. These objects are sometimes tangible (cups, bicycles, wheels) and sometimes abstract (red, anger, satisfaction, walking). Everything exists within a plane of continuum.</p>
<p>We discretise as we may deem fit. We create objects to explain the world around us and thus improve predictability.</p>
<p>For tangible objects, the boundaries are often created by our visual and--to a lesser extent--our tactile sensory information. The method is no different from, say, that used by edge-detection algorithms. Our mind continually looks for sharp changes in sensory fields. Sometimes it relies on higher-order rates of changes, too. In the continuum of atoms in space, our imaging retina gives us the bounds of various entities in our field of vision. The same can be said for the collision of our body parts with various entities that are essentially pockets of densely-packed atoms.</p>
<p>For the abstract, the boundaries are slightly fuzzier. The discretisation process is heavily governed by the culture--a necessity to define an object for a mental model that will help us navigate some constructs that makes sense in the context of the culture. For example, where does red end and mauve begin? Or, where does anger end and grudge begin? Or, where does satisfaction end and contentment begin? Or, where does walking end and running begin?</p>
<p>Let us revisit our tangible object. We can argue that the objectification of the entity depends on the culture as well. To an end user, a bicycle is an entity--an object as a whole. He might be aware of the parts and the names assigned to them as objects--the wheels, the saddle, the handlebar, etc. The wheel itself might built out of other objects--hub, bearings, spokes, nipples, rim, tube, tyre. A material scientist might argue that the tyre is composed of at least three different compounds of rubber--each having different names and different properties--each one carefully placed to improve rolling resistance as well as grip. This objectification doesn't exist in the vernacular of the common end-user of the bicycle.</p>
