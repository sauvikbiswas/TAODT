<h2>Tea is a metaphor for life itself.</h2>
<p>A tea leaf, after getting plucked, cannot be directly used for brewing. Once it is plucked, it must be wilted, crushed, oxidised and rolled before it can be used in any form. There is a transformation involved in the process, almost like a metamorphosis--a chain of chemical reactions that imparts flavour to the brew and meaning to its existence. The process is different for oolong, white, yellow, green, or fermented tea. Still, the struggle is real. It's different but real.</p>
<p>Obtaining a good brew is not difficult but requires mindfulness. Bring a cup of water to boil and take it off the heat. Let it cool down slightly--allowing the turbulence to disappear. Place a spoonful of tea leaves in the water. The stillness of the water allows the absorption of polyphenols and stimulants.</p>
<p>The brew time is different for different varietals. It might be of interest to observe how the water progressively turns darker with time. This is especially true for a batch that is new to you. Since different varietals and flushes attain different pigment shades at the end of perfect brewing time, it is important to periodically sip and check if the astringency levels are right. Once you are familiar with the brewing time of that batch, you can skip this process of titration.</p>
<p>This is no different from absorbing the essence of life around you. The laws that govern this world are chaotic at best and erratic at worst. How much of it you can distil into the stillness of your mind is a personal metric. Your preference of astringency may not match someone else's.</p>
<h2>The symbolism behind drinking tea</h2>
<p>The act of drinking tea takes on a different function when drinking in solitude and in the company of a fellow being.</p>
<p>When in solitude, it is a catalyst for meditation--a vehicle for contemplation of thoughts and solidification of ideas. As you delve deeper, data is distilled into information, information is assimilated into knowledge and knowledge is clustered into ideologies.</p>
<p>When drunk with fellow beings, it becomes a catalyst for exchanging news, ideas, myths and stories. They must be treated differently and require deferred processing--perhaps with a different cup of tea, all alone. Not many of those conversations will be remembered. Our brain has this amazing ability to discard whatever is not essential for self-benefit. We always tend to remember a piece of news that affects us or a story that appeals to our sense of entertainment or a statement that alters our sense of being. These are the things that act as fodder for a hungry mind.</p>
<p>No matter if you are drinking alone or with someone else, you are absorbing the essence of life itself along with the short-lived comfort and warmth of a brew.</p>
